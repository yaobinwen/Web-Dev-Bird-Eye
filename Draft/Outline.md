Many reasons:

- Most of the web development tutorials start with hands-on coding so you can build and run your first web site in maybe 5 minutes, the so-called "get your hands dirty", which excites you. However, such tutorials only show you "what" but not "why" and "how". As your hands get dirties and things become nasty, you have to know "why" and "how" in order to solve the issues.

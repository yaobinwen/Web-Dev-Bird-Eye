# Front-end Three Major Components

## Overview

This simple website shows the three major front-end technologies:

- HTML: The content and structure of the web page.
- CSS: The style of the content.
- JavaScript: The dynamic interaction.

## How to Run Locally

Follow the steps to run the website locally:

- Install Python 3.
- `cd` into the `FE-three-major-components` directory.
- Run `python3 -m http.server`.
  - By default, the server uses the port `8000`. If it is not available, use a different port `python3 -m http.server <PORT>`.
- On the browser, enter `http://localhost:8000`.
  - The `http.server` serves the `index.html` as the default page so we don't have to explicitly specify the HTML page to access.

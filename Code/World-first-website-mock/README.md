# World First Website (Mock!)

## Overview

This is an example website that shows how the world's first website was **probably** made. All the hyperlinks are linked to the real addresses.

The world's real first website is [here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).

## How to Run Locally

Follow the steps to run the website locally:

- Install Python 3.
- `cd` into the `World-first-website-mock` directory.
- Run `python3 -m http.server`.
  - By default, the server uses the port `8000`. If it is not available, use a different port `python3 -m http.server <PORT>`.
- On the browser, enter `http://localhost:8000/TheProject.html`

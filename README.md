# Web Dev Bird Eye

## What This Is And Isn't

This is a tutorial that looks at the web development technologies from the historical viewpoint. It lets you know what technologies are used for web development nowadays as well as **why** they were invented to solve what problems.

Although I may dive into the technical details whenever necessary, the tutorial does **NOT** intend to teach you how to use a particular technology. You won't see any detailed expalnation of what an HTML tag is or how to define a JavaScript function. There are millions of other tutorials for that purpose.

The point is: being a novice web developer, you don't know a lot of things. You don't even know what you don't know. This tutorial is trying to **show you what you don't know before so those "unknowns" now become "knowns" to you**. It's your next task to dive into the details. But finding out those unknowns can be a real pain.

This also explains why I call this tutorial a "bird's-eye" one: a bird's-eye view won't give you a lot of details, but allows you to see the big picture.

## Who This Is For

This tutorial is written with the _true novice web developers_ in mind.

Why _true novice web developers_? Because I am one of them. I had desktop application software development experience but _zero_ experience of web development. When I started to learn it, I felt a lot of pain. I therefore decided to share my thoughts about what I believe is helpful for any other developers like me to overcome the initial learning stope. In other words, I believe **what I have listed in this tutorial are those first and fundamental things every novice developer should learn to speed up their later learning**.

## I Need Help (and Thanks!)

Being a true novice web developer, I have the advantage of knowing what can be the pain for others like me. Meanwhile, that's also a huge disadvantage: **I don't know a lot of things about web development and its history**. Although I will do my best homework, I will surely also make mistakes. If you find mistakes, have suggestions, or happen to know some helpful references, feel free to open an issue in this repository or shoot me an email.

Really appreciate it!

# Web Dev: A Bird's-eye View for Novice Web Developers to Speed Up Learning

## Status

This tutorial is **NOT finished** yet.

## Who This Is For

This tutorial is written with the _true novice web developers_ in mind.

Why _true novice web developers_? Because I am one of them. I had desktop application software development experience but _zero_ experience of web development. When I started to learn it, I felt a lot of pain. I therefore decided to share my thoughts about what I believe is helpful for any other developers like me to overcome the initial learning stope. In other words, I believe **what I have listed in this tutorial are those first and fundamental things every novice developer should learn in order to speed up their later learning**.

But it's better that these "true novice web developers" already have some programming experience: they are new to web programming, not new to programming.

## What This Is and Isn't

This is a tutorial that shows you the web development technologies and how they are related with each other. It looks at them from a historical viewpoint so you will learn how they evolved and why they are what they are now.

Although I may dive into the technical details whenever necessary, the tutorial does **NOT** intend to teach you how to use a particular technology. For example, you won't see any detailed explanation of what an HTML tag is or how to define a JavaScript function. There are many other tutorials for those purposes.

**The point is**: being a novice web developer, you don't know a lot of things. Finding out those unknowns can be a real pain. This tutorial is trying to **show you what you don't know so those "unknowns" will become "knowns"**. It's your next task to dive into the details.

This also explains why I call this tutorial a "bird's-eye" one: a bird's-eye view won't give you a lot of details, but allows you to see the big picture.

## I Need Help (and Thanks!)

Being a true novice web developer, I have the advantage of knowing what can be the pain for others like me. Meanwhile, that's also a huge disadvantage: **I don't know a lot of things about web development and its history**. Although I will do my best homework, I will surely also make mistakes. If you find mistakes, have suggestions, or happen to know some helpful references, feel free to open an issue in this repository or shoot me an email.

Really appreciate it!

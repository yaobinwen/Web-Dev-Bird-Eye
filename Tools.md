# Tools

## Overview

This is a collection of all the tools I have come across when learning web development.

Most of them have a ".js" hat on.

The tools are ordered alphabetically under each category.

## List

### Bundling Tools

- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/): Its front page says Browserify "lets you require('modules') in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies."
- [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en): Its front page says rollup is "a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application."
- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/): Its front page simply says "module bundler". But it shows a quite nice picture to visualize what "bundle" means.
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/): A zero configuration build tool for the web.

### Module Loader

- [Require.js](https://requirejs.org/): RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader.
